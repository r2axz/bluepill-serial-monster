# bluepill-serial-monster

_bluepill-serial-monster_ is a firmware for _STM32 Blue Pill_ that turns it
into a _3 Port USB-to-Serial_ adapter. The firmware implements a USB 2.0
full-speed composite device that consists of 3 USB CDC devices.

_STM32 Blue Pill_ is a ridiculously cheap _STM32_ development board which
is available in many stores around the globe. The board contains decent
hardware that supports _USB 2.0 Full-Speed_, has 3 independent _USARTs_
and enough processing power to handle high-speed _UART_ communications.

**Note**: some _Blue Pill_ clones have an incorrect pull-up resistor soldered
to the _USB D+_ line (_PA12_) which prevents them from being successfully
detected by the host. Please refer to
[Fixing USB on Blue Pill Boards](#fixing-usb-on-blue-pill-boards)
for more information.

Some USB controllers work fine even with faulty _Blue Pill_ boards. If your
board works with your computer, don't bother fixing it.

## Features

## UART Signal Levels

Although _STM32F103C8T6_ installed on the Blue Pill board is a **3.3 V**
device, a number of its inputs are actually **5 V** tolerant.
This means you can safely use the selected inputs with **3.3** and **5 V**
TTL devices.

**Do not use non 5 V tolerant inputs with 5 V devices as doing that will
result in permanent damage of MCU inputs or MCU itself.**

**When configured as an output, none of the _STM32F103C8T6_ pins is 5 V
tolerant. Make sure you don't accidentally get more than 4.0 V on such pin
or damage may occur.**

**5 V** tolerant pins are shown **in bold** in the next section.

## UART Pinout

| Signal |   Direction   |     UART1     |     UART2     |     UART3     |
|:-------|:-------------:|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
|   RX   |      IN       |    **PA10**   |      PA3      |    **PB11**   |
|   TX   |      OUT      |      PA9      |      PA2      |      PB10     |
|   RTS  |      OUT      |    **PA15**   |      PA1      |      PB14     |

Note: **5 V** tolerant input pins are shown **in bold**.

## Control Signals (Default Configuration)

**RTS**, **CTS**, **DSR**, **DTR**, **DCD**, **RI** are **active-low** signals,
**TXA** is an active-high signal.

**TXA** (**TX** **A**ctive) is active when UART is transmitting data and
can be used to control **DE** and **/RE** pins of RS-485 transceivers.

**TXA** goes inactive within 0.6 us after the transmission is complete,
which meets RS-485 and IO-link timing requirements at speeds up to 920 kBaud
with almost double safety margin.

**DSR**, **DTR**, and **DCD**, **RI** are connected to the internal _weak pull-up_
resistors, so they remain inactive at rest.

**CTS** is **pulled down** internally, which enables _UART TX_ when nothing is
connected to **CTS**. Hardware flow control is always on, but it does not get
in the way of communications as long as nothing is connected to the flow control lines.

**RTS** can be controlled by the host, but as soon as the _UART RX_ buffer is
**half-full**, **RTS** is forced to the **inactive** state. As long as more than
one half of the buffer space is available, **RTS** remains in the state set
by the host. Please take this behaviour into account if you rely on the
**RTS** signal to control non-standard periphery.

**DSR**, **DCD**, and **RI** are polled 50 times per second.

_UART DMA RX/TX_ buffer size is **1024** bytes.

## Mapping Logical Port Names to Physical Ports

Unfortunately, operating systems ignore CDC port names reported by the firmware.
_Linux_ and _macOS_ tend to assign device numbers incrementally so that UART1 gets
the lowest and UART3 the highest **/dev/ttyACM...** (_Linux_) or
**/dev/tty.usbmodem...** (_macOS_) numbers. On the other hand, _Windows_ can get
pretty creative when assigning COM port numbers to USB CDC devices.

To find out which physical UART corresponds to a particular COM port on _Windows_,
open **Device Manager**, right click on the COM port under **Ports (COM & LPT)**,
and choose **Properties**. Open the **Details** tab and select
the **Bus reported device description** property.
The **Value** field will indicate the physical UART name.

## Windows Usbser.sys RTS Bug

All versions of _Windows_ have a bug in the USB CDC system driver (**usbser.sys**)
that affects RTS signal handling.

The driver does not send USB **SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE** messages when
the **RTS** state changes. However, on the **DTR** state change, the driver sends
a **SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE** message containing the updated states for both
**RTS** and **DTR** signals.

It is unknown why **usbser.sys** does this, but the disassembled code
of the driver suggests that sending **SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE** on **RTS** change
is simply left out by mistake. It looks like _Microsoft_ is not going to fix
this bug. However, it can be easily worked around.

The workaround for this bug is to update DTR (even to the same state) each time
RTS needs to be updated as in the example below:

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    HANDLE hComm = CreateFileA("\\\\.\\COM5", GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
        0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL);
    if (hComm == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
        printf("Error opening serial port\n");
    } else {
        printf("Serial port opened\n");
    }
    while (1) {
        // I don't know any easy (and reliable) way to get current DTR state in WinAPI unfortunately.
        // Probably the simplest solution is to keep current DTR value in a variable.
        EscapeCommFunction(hComm, SETRTS);
        EscapeCommFunction(hComm, CLRDTR); // or SETDTR, does not matter
        (void)getc(stdin);
        EscapeCommFunction(hComm, CLRRTS);
        EscapeCommFunction(hComm, CLRDTR); // or SETDTR, does not matter
        (void)getc(stdin);
    }
    CloseHandle(hComm);
    return 0;
}
```

Some existing software already does that. _CwType_, _Win-Test_, _CoolTerm_
are the examples of such software. Others like _N1MM Logger Plus_ or _Termite_
do not implement the workaround.

The RTS issue does not affect _Linux_ or _macOS_.

## Unexpected Echo or Garbage Characters in Linux

_Linux_ terminal subsystem echoes characters coming from a
_bluepill-serial-monster_ port back to this port until it is switched to
the raw more (see ```man 3 cfmakeraw```).

This behaviour is Linux-specific and is not related to
_bluepill-serial-monster_ itself. See
[this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14866899/linux-cdc-acm-device-unexpected-characters-sent-to-device)
for details.

Usually, this is not an issue; however, it may lead to garbage characters
appearing when the configuration shell is started. For instance, if **PA5**
is tied to the ground when _bluepill-serial-monster_ is plugged in, the device
sends the configuration mode banner to the host. The host echoes the content of
the banner back to the device, which in turn tries to parse it as if it was
a sequence of configuration shell commands. When _screen_ or another terminal
emulation software is started, its output may contain garbage characters left
due to the above exchange.

## Advanced Configuration

_bluepill-serial-monster_ provides a configuration shell that allows
controlling various parameters of the UART signal lines.

To access the configuration shell, open the first USB serial port (UART1)
with any terminal emulator application (such as _screen_, _Tera Term_, etc.). It
is enabled by default. To disable configuration shell - connect **PB5** to
ground. Serial port settings do not matter.

You should see the configuration shell prompt:

```text
*******************************
* Configuration Shell Started *
*******************************

>
```

The configuration shell has minimal support for ANSI escape sequences. You can
use the arrow keys to move the cursor when editing a command, erase text with _Backspace_,
and insert text anywhere in the command. You can also recall the last command
by pressing _UP_.

Command and parameter names are case-sensitive.

To get the list of available commands, type:

```text
>help
```

To get command-specific help, type:

```text
>help command-name
```

### UART Port Parameters

UART port parameters can be viewed and set with the _uart_ command:

```text
>help uart
uart: set and view UART parameters
Usage: uart port-number|all show|signal-name-1 param-1 value-1 ... [param-n value-n] [signal-name-2 ...]
Use "uart port-number|all show" to view current UART configuration.
Use "uart port-number|all signal-name-1 param-1 value-1 ... [param-n value-n] [signal-name-2 ...]"
to set UART parameters, where signal names are rx, tx, rts, cts, dsr, dtr, dcd,
and params are:
  output        [pp|od]
  active        [low|high]
  pull          [floating|up|down]
Example: "uart 1 tx output od" sets UART1 TX output type to open-drain
Example: "uart 3 rts active high dcd active high pull down" allows to set multiple parameters at once.
```

Changes to the UART parameters are applied instantly; however, the configuration
is not stored in the flash memory until you explicitly save it with:

```text
>config save
```

To view current configuration of all UART ports, type:

```text
>uart all show
```

To view current configuration of a particular UART port, type:

```text
>uart port-number show
```

where _port-number_ is in range of 1 to 3.

Output type can be set for any output signal. Available output types are:

* **pp** for push-pull output;
* **od** for open-drain output;

Example:

```text
uart 1 tx output od
```

Pull type can be set for any input signal. Available pull types are:

* **floating** for floating input;
* **up** for weak pull up;
* **down** for weak pull down;

Example:

```text
uart 1 dcd pull up
```

Signal polarity can be set for all input and output signals except for **RX**,
**TX**, and **CTS**. Available signal polarities are:

* **low** for active-low signal polarity;
* **high** for active-high signal polarity;

Example:

```text
uart 1 rts active high
```

It is possible to set multiple signal parameters for multiple signals in one
command:

```text
uart 1 tx output od rts output od active high
```

If the uart command encounters a syntax error or an invalid parameter in
the middle of a multiple parameters command line, it stops execution
immediately. However, it does not roll back valid parameters set before
the point where the error occured.

It is also possible to set signal parameters for multiple ports in one command:

```text
uart all tx output od
```

### Saving and Resetting Configuration

To permanently save current device configuration, type:

```text
config save
```

To reset the device to the default settings, type:

```text
config reset
```

### Printing the Firmware Version

To print the firmware version, type:

```text
version
```

The default configuration is automatically stored in the flash memory after reset.

## Flashing Firmware

Download binary firmware from the
[Releases](https://github.com/r2axz/bluepill-serial-monster/releases) page.

Flash with [ST-LINK](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html)
or similar programmer.

```bash
st-flash --format ihex write bluepill-serial-monster.hex
```

It is also possible to flash _STM32F103C8T6_ via a built-in serial bootloader. Visit
[https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html)
for instructions and software.

You can also use _bluepill-serial-monster-stm32duino-0x8002000.bin_ or _bluepill-serial-monster-stm32duino-0x8005000.bin_ with [STM32duino-bootloader](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader) and [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net).

## Windows Driver (WinXP, 7, 8)

_Windows_ versions prior to _Windows 10_ require an _INF_ file that maps
the device Vendor ID / Product ID to the Microsoft _usbser.sys_ CDC ACM driver.
_Windows 10_ does not require this and loads the standard driver automatically.

A signed _INF_ file for _Windows XP, 7, and 8_ is included in the distribution.
To install the _INF_ file, plug in _bluepill-serial-monster_ and point _Windows_
to a directory containing both **bluepill-serial-monster.inf** and
**bluepill-serial-monster.cat** files during a new device installation.

Alternatively, you can open _Windows Device Manager_, right-click on any of the
_Bluepill Serial Monster_ devices, choose _Update driver_ and point Windows to
the _INF_ file directory from there.

## Fixing USB on Blue Pill Boards

_STM32 Blue Pill_ boards come in slightly different variations. Nevertheless,
their schematic is very similar. Below you will find the instructions on how to
identify and replace the incorrect USB pull-up resistor on any _Blue Pill_ board.

With a digital multimeter, measure resistance between **PA12** and **3.3 V**
pads on the board. If the resistance reads close to **1.5k** (**1500 ohms**),
then your board is either non-faulty or faulty for some other reason,
and this section does not apply.

If the resistance if far away from **1.5k** (such as **4.7k** or **10k**),
you will have to locate the incorrect resistor on the board and replace it
with a **1.5k** or **1.8k** resistor.

If your board has component names on it, locate **R10**. Otherwise, trace the
board to find the incorrect resistor.

Once you identified the incorrect resistor, replace it with a **1.5k** or
**1.8k** resistor.

## Building Firmware

### Prerequisites

Install the following software:

* [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [arm-none-eabi toolchain](
    https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
* [open source st-link](<https://github.com/texane/stlink>)
* [STM32CubeF1](
    <https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubef1.html>)

Here is an example assuming everything is installed in ~/stm32/,
and we use _bash_:

ARM toolchain and st-link must be added to PATH.

```bash
# add ARM toolchain path
export PATH=~/stm32/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin:$PATH
# add stlink path
export PATH=~/stm32/stlink-install/bin:$PATH
```

Path to STM32CubeF1 should be also exported (use ~/.bash_profile):

```bash
# export STM32Cube
export STM32CUBE_PATH=~/stm32/stm32cube
```

## Building

To build the firmware, **cd** to the project directory and run

```bash
make
```

To flash the MCU using st-link, run

```bash
make flash
```

To remove object and dependency files, run

```bash
make clean
```

To remove object, dependency, and firmware files, run

```bash
make distclean
```

### Building for DFU Bootloaders

_DFU_ bootloaders generally require the firmware origin to be relocated
to a higher flash address to allow room for the bootloader itself.
The bootloader documentation should specify the firmware upload address.
By default, _bluepill-serial-monster_ firmware starts at flash origin (0x8000000).
To move the firmware to a custom address, use the **FIRMWARE_ORIGIN** Makefile variable:

```bash
make clean && make FIRMWARE_ORIGIN=0xXXXXXXXX
```

where 0xXXXXXXXX is the required firmware start address.

The firmware release package already includes two prebuilt binaries for use with
[STM32duino-bootloader](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader).
